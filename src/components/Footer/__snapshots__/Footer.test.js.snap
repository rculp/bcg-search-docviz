<div

  Here is a sticky footer. If there is not enough content above, it will remain at the bottom of the page.
  <br />
  <br />
  If there is enough content above, it will move below the bottom of the viewport. Note that this behavior remains consistent even when the footer is given padding. It also obeys the bottom padding of the container above if it wishes to add extra space before encountering the footer.
