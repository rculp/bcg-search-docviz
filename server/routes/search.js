Objective was to build one global SAP system in order to standardize, consolidate and fully harmonize IT.The heavy business transformation started by the client was stopped because the system integrator in charge esteemed the effort being too comples. Our role was to assist the client in setting up a project management office (PMO) to have transparency of the project status and improve project efficiency.The first deck gives an overview of the (new) set-up and organization of the ERP project.The second deck outlines the structure of the PMO and the progress tracking principles.The third deck explains how to build the planning for an ERP project and how to follow up the planning.The last deck focuses on project planning and monitoring of SAP template builds and roll-outs.",

A specific cell in the company was established for following up the realisations in all the 22 priorities. We have introduced a PMO approach for the cell. To this end, we grouped the 22 priorities into 6 programs and created the role of PROGRAM COORDINATOR to manage the relations between the priorities in the program. To support correct application and evolution of the PMO methodology alongside the client's future needs, we also created the role \"REPRESENTATIVE OF THE METHODOLOGY\".Following documents are attached:A.

Impact Structure Several BUs signed up to deliver a top-down cost savings target over three years Enterprise required line of sight on how these savings would be achieved A portion of the savings would be realized immediately through FTE takeout initiatives Created and launched full Roadmaps for these FTE-based initiatives, so that savings could be tracked immediately However, remaining cost savings did not have clearly laid out plans, and would not have profit impacts within the first 6 months, anyway Created separate \"Umbrella\" Roadmaps as a plug to fill the cost savings gap, and to lay out the path to develop specific initiatives with separate Roadmaps within 2 months Client Situation Impact Structure for Umbrella Roadmap Ensures the total impact is still accounted for by linking the Umbrella Roadmap to a \"gap\" figure Umbrella Roadmap expires once it is split into individual Roadmaps that support specific initiatives - client was given 2 months to flesh out their individual initiatives Plan x CLIENT EXAMPLE OF AN UMBRELLA ROADMAP (II) Summary Section Roadmap Owner and Project Sponsor are typically the same person since the actual initiatives have not yet been defined x Helpful to still include as much detail as possible so that the program office knows roughly where the impacts will come from, and roughly when they will be delivered Plan ONCE DRAFT ROADMAP IS DEVELOPED THE ëRIGOR {b}TEST{nb}' IS APPLIED The ëRigor {b}Test{nb}' is a series of questions asked about each Roadmap to ensure that it is consistent and high quality Helps to prevent ëgarbage in, garbage out' There are two main times when the Rigor {b}test{nb} is applied By the Roadmap Owner (Team Leader/Change Manager) when developing the Roadmap plan By the Roadmap Approvers when assessing whether to accept the Roadmap Roadmaps are only accepted, locked down (frozen) and added into the tracking system when the Roadmap Approvers decide that they have passed the Rigor {b}Test{nb} It is not uncommon for a prospective Roadmap to initially fail the Rigor {b}Test{nb} Collaboration between the Roadmap Approver and the Roadmap owner helps prevent unnecessary reiterations Plan THE RIGOR {b}TEST{nb} ADDRESSES TWO MAIN AREAS TO ENSURE HIGH QUALITY ROADMAPS Disaggregation of overall impacts into financial and operational KPIs Use of OP KPIs as lead indicators of subsequent financial impact delivery Quantification of potential recurring and one-time costs, benefits Quantification of potential capital expenditure and asset implications Consistency in timing between milestones and associated impacts Practical and measurable treatment of revenue uplift Clarity of impacts, their sources and timing Logical disaggregation of roadmap into 7-20 milestones Definition of milestones to

The deck is structured around three main topics:  Planning & Preparation: A discussion of the processes of implementation plan development including Roadmap objectives and ownership, project team membership, DICE scores, milestones (including attached timing and impact structure), and \"rigor\" testing.  Prioritization: A discussion of various bases for prioritizing competing initiatives, and the considerations associated with the inclusion of priority initiatives in the strategic and business plans.  Execution Monitoring & Management: An in depth discussion of the three key parameters to be monitored and managed, throughout the course of an implementation program: DICEô scores, progress against milestones, and delivery against impact targets. Also included for reference is the excel based Roadmap Template.  This document contains the suggested and preformatted implementation planning templates, designed to be consistent with input into the Roadmapping tracking software tool (following finalization and Rigor Testing of the roadmap).",

It shows how to set up a research plan - from problem-definition, selection of the appropriate agency, data analysis to report generation and documentation. It helps deciding which research methods should best be applied in a certain context and what it means for selecting the right partner. It focuses on client projects which do strongly rely on customer behaviour and motivations as well as marketing data. The document includes a large list of contacts of recommendable market and consumer research partners - we have gathered all over the world. It is meant for being gradually up-dated with the best contacts we have, so that we can benefit from each other's experience and cooperation with market research institutes (during the project, i.e. during the field work and the evaluation period but as well before, i.e.: selection and pitching period). Document / contacts updated in October 2006.",

In-stock products are often an untapped opportunity for Client's to grow revenue.   The traditional focus has been on supply chain issues, but over 70% of the problem is driven by in-store rather than upstream causes.  The deck discusses how to improve in-stock problems that are caused by in-store drivers, rather than supply chain issues, and demonstrates why manufacturers need to partner with their key retail customers to realize revenue growth.   The appendix is a compendium of key findings and tools for use by case teams working on in-stock projects.",
